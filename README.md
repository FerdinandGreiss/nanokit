# nanokit

Process movies and analyse protein synthesis spots from single DNA molecules immobilized on a surface. 

This repository contains two Python scripts to perform these jobs:

1) **drift-correction**: Correct lateral drift in fluorescence movies using fiducial markers (e.g. TetraSpeck microspheres)
2) **data-analysis**: Analyze protein expression spots from surface-immobilized DNA molecules with *E. coli* cell lysate

Detailed descriptions of how to run and what output these scripts generate are given in the Python files.
